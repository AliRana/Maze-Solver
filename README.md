# Maze-Solver
This is a Maze Solver I created for my A-Level Coursework for my Computer Science subject. I completed this code during my time at South Wolverhampton and Bilston Academy where I achieved 92% for the coursework which was an A*. It used a assortment of complex graph algorithms like the A* and Dijkstra's algorithms..
