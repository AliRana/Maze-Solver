# Maze-Solver
This is a Maze Solver I created for my A-Level Coursework for my Computer Science subject. I completed this code during my time at South Wolverhampton and Bilston Academy where I achieved 92% for the coursework which was an A*. It used a assortment of complex graph algorithms like the A* and Dijkstra's algorithms.There are multiple versions of the cpdebase, as I was unable to use Git/Github at the time, however I decided that it would be beneficial to add this for future reference. There should only be one file that is the code in its final state. NOTE: THIS CODE WILL NOT RUN PROPERLY WITHOUT A DISTANCE/LIGHT DETECTOR OR THE ROBOT I CREATED.
